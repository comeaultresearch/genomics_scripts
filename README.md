# genomics_scripts
A collection of scripts used to handle genomic data / generate input files for analyses.

A word of caution - many of these scripts will have certain parameters hard-coded and specific to a given data set. I've tried to highlight those instances with a "## !! HARD CODED * !! ##" flag.
